\section{Parareal}

We would like to solve the autonomous ordinary differential equation:
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{cases}
    u'(t) = f(u), & t \in [t_0, t_f] \\
    u(t_0) = u_0
  \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
where $f : \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}^d$ and $u: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}^d$.

Parareal is an iterative scheme to approximate $u$ for the above, which can be
derived from the concept of \textit{multiple shooting} methods. The idea behind
these methods are to turn the problem into a nonlinear optimization problem,
which then can be solved via Newton-Raphson. \cite{gandervandewalle}

Take our time domain $[t_0, t_f]$ and partition it into $N$ pieces $0 = t_0 <
\dots < t_N = t_f$. Looking specifically at the interval $[t_n, t_{n+1}]$, we
pose the new ODE:
\[
  \begin{cases}
    u'_n = f(u_n), & t \in [t_n, t_{n+1}] \\
    u(t_n) = U_n
  \end{cases}
\]`
where $U_n$ is such that $U_n - u_{n-1}(t_n, U_{n-1}) = 0$, i.e. the initial
condition satisfies the solution to the previous time slice. The conditions on
$U_i$ form a nonlinear system $F(U) = 0$, which we can approximate using
Newton-Raphson, so recieve the iteration $U^{k+1} = U^k - J_F^{-1}(U^k)F(U^k)$.
