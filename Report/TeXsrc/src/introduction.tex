\section{Introduction}

The parareal algorithm was originally proposed by Lions, Maday, and Turinici
\cite{original} as a numerical method to solve ordinary differential equations
that was parallel capable over the time domain. Here we intend to given a
overview of the method, and it's properties. In section 2 we describe the
parareal iteration, which later in 3 we discuss how to implement efficiently
using the parallel library OpenMP. Then in 4 we discuss the parallel efficiency
of this implementation, and measure the scalability of it in a high performance
computing context. Then in 5 and 6 we examine the analytic properties of the
method, deriving stability criteria and measuring and deriving theoretical
convergence rates.
