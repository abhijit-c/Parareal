\section{Convergence Analysis}

Now down to the main point, we would like to analyze and confirm the convergence
of the Parareal method. First we derive a theoretical result, and then confirm
it through numerical expirements.

\subsection{Theoretical Convergence}

Suppose we have the following ordinary differential equation:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{cases}
    u' = f(t,u), \quad t > 0 \\
    u(0) = u_0
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}

In addition suppose we have the course operator $\course(t^{n+1},t^n,u^n)$ and
the fine operator $\fine(t^{n+1}, t^n, u^n)$ with the following properties:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item On $\course(t^{n+1},t^n,u^n)$:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Suppose this operator has order $m$.
      \item Suppose it's Lipschitz in the initial condition:
        \[
          \norm{\course(t^{n+1},t^n,u)-\course(t^{n+1},t^n,v)} \leq 
          C\norm{u - v} 
        \]
        In particular we write $C = (1 + L \Delta t)$.
    \end{itemize}
  \item With respect to $\fine(t^{n+1}, t^n, u^n)$, we suppose it's accurate
    enough to be assumed to be the true solution $u^*$. This means that if
    $\course$ is accurate with order $m$ to the true solution, then it too will
    be so to $\fine$.
\end{enumerate}

Then we can prove the following theorem:

\begin{theorem*}
  The parareal method with course operator $\course$ and fine operator $\fine$
  has order of accuracy $mk$, where $k-1$ is the number of parareal iterations
  made. \cite{balarticle} \cite{fieldstalk}
\end{theorem*}
\begin{proof}
  We proceed via induction on $k$ and $n$. Suppose $k = 1$, then it is trivial,
  this is the course operator, and for $n = 0$, this is the initial condition
  which we know to any accuracy.

  Now suppose for $k,n > 1$, that we know:
  \[
    \norm{u(t^n) - u_k^n} \leq \norm{u_0}C(\Delta t)^{mk}, 
  \]
  We want to show that:
  \[
    \norm{u(t^n) - u_{k+1}^n} \leq \norm{u_0}C(\Delta t)^{m(k+1)}
  \]
  To proceed, recall that $\fine$ is assumed to be a good approximation for
  $u(t^n)$, so we may write:
  \begin{align*}
    \norm{u(t^n) - u_{k+1}^n} & = \norm{\fine(u(t^{n-1})) -
    \course(u^{n-1}_{k+1}) - \fine(u^{n-1}_k) + \course(u^{n-1}_k)} \\
    & = \norm{\course(u(t^{n-1})) + \delta \course (u(t^{n-1}))  -
    \course(u^{n-1}_{k+1}) - \delta \course(u^{n-1}_k)} \\
    & \leq \norm{\course(u(t^{n-1})) - \course(u^{n-1}_{k+1})} + 
    \norm{ \delta \course (u(t^{n-1})) - \delta \course(u^{n-1}_k)} \\
    & \leq (1+L\Delta t)\norm{u(t^{n-1}) - u^{n-1}_{k+1}} + 
    C(\Delta t)^{m+1}\norm{ u(t^{n-1}) - u^{n-1}_k} \\
    & \leq (1+L\Delta t)\norm{u(t^{n-1}) - u^{n-1}_{k+1}} + 
    C(\Delta t)^{m+1}(\Delta t)^{mk}\norm{ u_0 } \\
    & \leq (1+L\Delta t)\norm{u(t^{n-1}) - u^{n-1}_{k+1}} + 
    C(\Delta t)^{m(k+1)+1}\norm{ u_0 } \\
  \end{align*}
  At this point, note that the left hand term is the approximation of $u$ at the
  previous time step, which we can assume to also be of the order $m(k+1)$.
  Therefore, we can say that $\norm{u(t^n) - u_{k+1}^n} = \mathcal{O}(\Delta
  t^{m(k+1)})$, completing our inductive step.
\end{proof}
